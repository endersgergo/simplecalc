# SimpleCalc
A (truly) simple /calc command provider for Minecraft using objecthunter's __exp4j__ expression parser and evaluation library.

You can evaluate arbitrary mathematical expressions in-game by typing ``/calc eval <expression>`` for quick or complex calculations without fancy (bloated) GUIs. The mod also provides a simple help command listing the available functions and variables that you can use in expressions (see the [exp4j](https://lallafa.objecthunter.net/exp4j/index.html)'s homepage for more on expressions).

## Credits
Big thanks to objecthunter! Without their exp4j library, this wouldn't have been possible (hassle-free least).
