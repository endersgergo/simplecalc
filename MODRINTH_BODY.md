# SimpleCalc
A (truly) simple /calc command provider for Minecraft using objecthunter's exp4j expression parser and evaluation library.

You can evaluate arbitrary expressions in-game by typing ``/calc eval <expression>``. The mod also provides a simple help command listing the available functions and variables that you can use in expressions.
