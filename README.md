# SimpleCalc

A (truly) simple /calc command provider for Minecraft using objecthunter's [exp4j](https://lallafa.objecthunter.net/exp4j/index.html) expression parser and evaluation library.

As it is, I think the code is _ugly_ and may do some clean up sometime later...

## Building
```
$ git clone https://github.com/endersgergo/simplecalc.git
$ cd simplecalc
$ gradlew remapJar
```

## Contributions
Contributions are welcome, but remember to use common sense and keep new features to a minimum. It is meant to be a _simple_ mod, after all.

## Licenses

## Credits
Big thanks to objecthunter! Without their exp4j library, this wouldn't have been possible (hassle-free, at least).
